### DIVE INTO DEEP LEARNING

#### OPEN SOURCE BOOK :
##### https://d2l.ai

This repository gathers various implementations of deep learning algorithms.

Each algorithm is a mixture of using the corresponding section in the book to keep the structure correct (via the mathematical model or the schematic version), various implementation inspirations or practical tips gathered from the internet, or personal follies that materialize my quest for experimentation. But at no time do I allow myself to copy and paste, this self-destructive practice is forbidden to me.
